Failed to publish the Move module(s), reason: [warning] Multiple source verification errors found: - Local dependency did not match its on-chain version at 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002::Sui::object - Local version of dependency 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002::authenticator_state was not found. This may indicate that the on-chain version(s) of your package's dependencies may behave differently than the source version(s) your package was built against. Fix this by rebuilding your packages with source versions matching on-chain versions of dependencies, or ignore this warning by re-running with the --skip-dependency-verification flag.
