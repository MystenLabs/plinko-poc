# `@mysten/wallet-standard`

A suite of standard utilities for implementing wallets and libraries based on the [Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard/).

## Implementing the Wallet Standard in an extension wallet

### Creating a wallet interface

You need to create a class that represents your wallet. You can use the `Wallet` interface from `@mysten/wallet-standard` to help ensure your class adheres to the standard.

```typescript
import { Wallet, SUI_DEVNET_CHAIN } from "@mysten/wallet-standard";

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
  get version() {
    // Return the version of the Wallet Standard this implements (in this case, 1.0.0).
    return "1.0.0";
  }
  get name() {
    return "Wallet Name";
  }
  get icon() {
    return "some-icon-data-url";
  }

  // Return the Sui chains that your wallet supports.
  get chains() {
    return [SUI_DEVNET_CHAIN];
  }
}
```

### Implementing features

Features are standard methods consumers can use to interact with a wallet. To be listed in the Sui wallet adapter, you must implement the following features in your wallet:

- `standard:connect` - Used to initiate a connection to the wallet.
- `standard:events` - Used to listen for changes that happen within the wallet, such as accounts being added or removed.
- `sui:signTransactionBlock` - Used to prompt the user to sign a transaction block, and return the serializated transaction block and signature back to the user. This method does not submit the transaction block for execution.
- `sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock` - Used to prompt the user to sign a transaction block, then submit it for execution to the blockchain.

You can implement these features in your wallet class under the `features` property:

```typescript
import {
  StandardConnectFeature,
  StandardConnectMethod,
  StandardEventsFeature,
  StandardEventsOnMethod,
  SuiFeatures,
  SuiSignTransactionBlockMethod,
  SuiSignAndExecuteTransactionBlockMethod
} from "@mysten/wallet-standard";

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
  get features(): StandardConnectFeature & StandardEventsFeature & SuiFeatures {
    return {
      "standard:connect": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        connect: this.#connect,
      },
      "standard:events": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        on: this.#on,
      },
      "sui:signTransactionBlock": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        signTransactionBlock: this.#signTransactionBlock,
      },
      "sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock": {
        version: "1.1.0",
        signAndExecuteTransactionBlock: this.#signAndExecuteTransactionBlock,
      },
      'sui:signMessage': {
        version: '1.0.0',
        signMessage: this.#signMessage,
      },
    };
  },

  #on: StandardEventsOnMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's on implementation.
  };

  #connect: StandardConnectMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's implementation
  };

  #signTransactionBlock: SuiSignTransactionBlockMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's implementation
  };

  #signAndExecuteTransactionBlock: SuiSignAndExecuteTransactionBlockMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's implementation
  };

  #signMessage: SuiSignMessageMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's implementation
  };
}
```

### Exposing accounts

The last requirement of the wallet interface is to expose an `acccounts` interface. This should expose all of the accounts that a connected dapp has access to. It can be empty prior to initiating a connection through the `standard:connect` feature.

The accounts can use the `ReadonlyWalletAccount` class to easily construct an account matching the required interface.

```typescript
import { ReadonlyWalletAccount } from "@mysten/wallet-standard";

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
  get accounts() {
    // Assuming we already have some internal representation of accounts:
    return someWalletAccounts.map(
      (walletAccount) =>
        // Return
        new ReadonlyWalletAccount({
          address: walletAccount.suiAddress,
          publicKey: walletAccount.pubkey,
          // The Sui chains that your wallet supports.
          chains: [SUI_DEVNET_CHAIN],
          // The features that this account supports. This can be a subset of the wallet's supported features.
          // These features must exist on the wallet as well.
          features: ["sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock"],
        })
    );
  }
}
```

### Registering in the window

Once you have a compatible interface for your wallet, you can register it using the `registerWallet` function.

```typescript
import { registerWallet } from "@mysten/wallet-standard";

registerWallet(new YourWallet());
```
