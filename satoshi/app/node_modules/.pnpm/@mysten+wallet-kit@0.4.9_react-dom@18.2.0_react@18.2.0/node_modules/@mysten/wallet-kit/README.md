Sui Wallet Kit is a library that makes it easy to connect your dApp to Sui wallets. It wraps the underlying Sui Wallet Adapters and comes pre-configured with sane defaults.

## Getting started

To get started in a React application, you can install the following packages:

```bash
npm install @mysten/wallet-kit
```

At the root of your application, you can then set up the wallet kit provider:

```tsx
import { WalletKitProvider } from "@mysten/wallet-kit";

export function App() {
  return <WalletKitProvider>{/* Your application... */}</WalletKitProvider>;
}
```

> The `WalletKitProvider` also supports an `adapters` prop, which lets you override the default Sui Wallet Adapters.

You can then add a **Connect Wallet** button to your page:

```tsx
import { ConnectButton, useWalletKit } from "@mysten/wallet-kit";
import { formatAddress } from "@mysten/sui.js";

function ConnectToWallet() {
  const { currentAccount } = useWalletKit();
  return (
    <ConnectButton
      connectText={"Connect Wallet"}
      connectedText={`Connected: ${formatAddress(currentAccount.address)}`}
    />
  );
}
```

To get access to the currently connected wallet, use the `useWalletKit()` hook to interact with the wallet, such as proposing transactions:

```tsx
import { TransactionBlock } from "@mysten/sui.js";
import { useWalletKit } from "@mysten/wallet-kit";

export function SendTransaction() {
  const { signAndExecuteTransactionBlock } = useWalletKit();

  const handleClick = async () => {
    const tx = new TransactionBlock();
    tx.moveCall({
      target: "0x2::devnet_nft::mint",
      arguments: [
        tx.pure("some name"),
        tx.pure("some description"),
        tx.pure(
          "https://cdn.britannica.com/94/194294-138-B2CF7780/overview-capybara.jpg?w=800&h=450&c=crop"
        ),
      ],
    });
    await signAndExecuteTransactionBlock({ transactionBlock: tx });
  };

  return (
    <Button onClick={handleClick} disabled={!connected}>
      Send Transaction
    </Button>
  );
}
```

### Usage without React

We do not currently have non-React UI libraries for connecting to wallets. The wallet adapters and logic in the React library (`@mysten/wallet-adapter-react`) can be used as reference for implementing a wallet connection UI in other UI libraries.

## Supported wallets

Wallet Kit comes pre-configured with every supported wallet. You can also install individual wallet adapters that you plan on using in your project.

### Wallet Standard

The `WalletStandardAdapterProvider` adapter (published under `@mysten/wallet-adapter-wallet-standard`) automatically supports wallets that adhere to the cross-chain [Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard/). This adapter detects the available wallets in users' browsers. You do not need to configure additional adapters.
