# PoC Template app/ directory - UI, API & DB

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
This project is using the [NextJS App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), and therefore following a corresponding project structure.

### Usage

- Install the npm dependencies with: `pnpm install`
- Start the development server with `pnpm run dev`
- Build the project with: `pnpm run build`
- Serve the built project with: `pnpm run start`

### Directories structure

- `src/`
  - `app/`:
    - contains all the .tsx files, that are renderred as pages of the UI
    - organized in subdirectories based on the desired URL path of each page in the final UI
    - for more details, see: [NextJS App Router: Defining Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes)
  - `components/`:
    - contains the code for all the tsx components
    - organized in subdirectories based on the usage of each component
  - `constants/`
  - `contexts/`:
    - contains the code for all the React Providers and Contexts used to organize the project's global storage
  - `helpers/`
  - `hooks/`:
    - contains the TS code for all the custom react hooks that are being used in this app
  - `lib/`:
    - auto-generated directory, created upon the setup of the Radix UI and Shadcn libraries
  - `styles/`:
    - contains the global css file, used mainly for the colors of the UI components
  - `types/`:
    - contains some globally used TS interfaces of the project

### Main libraries used in the UI

- UI components:
  - [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
  - [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- Sui integration:
  - [Mysten Sui js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mysten/sui.js)
  - [Mysten Enoki SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mysten/enoki)
- Forms:
  - [React hook form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
  - [Zod](https://zod.dev/)

- PWA:
  - [Next PWA](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-pwa)

### Theming

- Three different main layouts exist in the source code:
  1. A layout for large screens with a Top Navbar
  2. A layout for large screens with a Left Side Navbar, and a Top AppBar
  3. A layout for mobile devices with a Bottom Navbar, and a Top AppBar
- To quickly choose the layout you prefer for large screens, you can set the env variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_TOP_NAVBAR_IN_LARGE_SCREEN` to either `1` or `0`
- In order to have different coloring inside the app, based on the role of the current user:
  - we wrap our components with the `role-{user.role}` class, inside the `LargeScreenLayout` (app/src/components/layouts/LargeScreenLayout.tsx) or the `MobileLayout` (app/src/components/layouts/MobileLayout.tsx) components
  - inside the `app/src/styles/globals.css` directory, we define different primary, secondary, (text) contrast, and (text) contrast-disabled colors under the classes `.role-admin`, `.role-moderator`, `.role-member`, `.role-anonymous`
  - this way, we just use the primary color in our UI components code, and their coloring is changing automatically based on the role of the current user

### Responsive layout

- The layout of the UI is changing based on the size of the device's screen
  - In large screens (width >= 768px), the general layout is consistent of either a Top Navbar or a collapsible sidebar
  - In small screens (width < 768px), the general layout is consistent of a bottom navbar
- To achieve this, we use the tailwind css breakpoints, and in some cases the custom hook `useIsMobile` (app/src/hooks/useIsMobile.ts) which can (and eventually will) be replaced with the tailwind css breakpoints

### Navigation Links

- The links displayed in the NavBars of the template are retrieved based on the current user's role, as it defined in the `navigationsByUserRole.tsx` file (app/src/components/layouts/navbars/navigationsByUserRole.tsx)

### Adding a new page to the UI

- This NextJS project was bootstrapped with the [NextJS App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing)
- To add a new page in the `/example` path, head into `/app/src/app` directory, and:
  - create an `example` directory
  - create a `page.tsx` (naming convention of the framework) file under it
  - export your component as the `default export`
- In the same way, to add a new page in the `example/of/nested/path`, head into the `/app/src/app` directory, and:
  - create the nested `example/of/nested/path` directories:
  - create a `page.tsx` file under it
  - export your component as the `default export`
  - you can check the existing `/admin/test` page as an example
- To set up a page with `dynamic routing` (for example http://localhost:3000/posts/3), follow the steps of this guide: [NextJS App Router Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes)

### Adding a new endpoint to the API

- This NextJS project was bootstrapped with the [NextJS App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing)
- To add a new endpoint in the `/api/example` path, head into `/app/src/app/api` directory, and:

  - create an `example` directory
  - create a `route.ts` (naming convention of the framework) file under it
  - name your function based on the HTTP method you would like to use
    - For example export const `GET`, export const `POST`
  - in case of integrating with the `vercel KV storage`, add the following lines to disable the default caching behaviour on the deployed environment (see `api/visits/route.ts` as an example)
    - before the function:
      - export const fetchCache = "force-no-store";
      - export const revalidate = 1;
    - inside the function:
      - const path = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get("path") || "/";
      - revalidatePath(path);

- To set up an endpoint with `dynamic routing` (for example http://localhost:3000/api/posts/3), follow the steps of this guide: [NextJS App Router Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes)
- The syntax to access the dynamic routing parameter inside the endpoint is:
  ```
  export const GET = async (
    request: NextRequest,
    { params }: { params: { id: string } }
  ) => {
    ...
  }
  ```

### Developing a new PoC with different names of the user roles

- In case that the names of the user roles are not suitable for your PoC, for example if you want to rename `moderator` to `publisher`, take the following steps:
  - In the `app/src/constants/USER_ROLES.ts` file:
    - change the value of the corresponding key: - ROLE_2: "publisher",
      -In the `app/src/types/Authentication.ts` file:
    - change the corresponding choice for the UserRole type:
      - export type UserRole = "admin" | "publisher" | "member" | "anonymous";
  - Rename the corresponding directory so that NextJS auto-updates the routes:
    - rename the `app/src/app/moderator` directory to `app/src/app/publisher`
  - Edit the auth middleware in the corresponding `layout.tsx` file:
    - in the `app/src/app/publisher/layout.tsx` file:
      - change the condition to: `if (user?.role !== "publisher")`
  - (Optional) You can also rename the components in the `app/src/app/publisher/page.tsx` file from `ModeratorHomePage` to `PublisherHomePage` for homogeneity

### Integration with Sui

- In the Template PoC, we use the Typescript Enoki SDK to sign the transactions
- The signing and the execution of the transacions are happening in separate steps, in order to be able to explicitly specify the url of the full node in the `executeSignedTransactionBlock` of the custom `useSui` (app/src/hooks/useSui.ts) hook
- A simple example of creating, signing, and executing a `TransactionBlock` from the UI is developed in the `useTransferSUI` (app/src/hooks/useTransferSUI.ts) custom hook, which is used in the `TransferSUIForm` (app/src/components/transferSUI/TransferSUIForm.tsx) component

### Local development with Vercel KV

- Of course at first:
  - create a `new project` in the vercel UI
  - `import` the corresponding `GitHub repo` from MystenLabs (need to ask for access if it is not listed)
  - In the `Storage` tab create and attach a Vercel KV Storage instance
- To be able to connect with the vercel KV storage in the local development environment, please follow the steps:
  - install vercel cli
  - run `vercel link` in the root directory of the project
  - select `Mysten Labs`
  - link to existing project
  - run `vercel env pull app/.env.development.local`
    - the created `app/.env.development.local` file should have the same format with the `app/.env.development.local.example` directory
  - start the dev server with:
    - `pnpm run dev` inside the app directory
    - or `vercel dev` in the project's root directory
  - visit the url: `http://localhost:3000/api/visits` in your browser, and observe the `pageVisits` counter being incremented with each visit

### PWA features

- The PoC Template is a `Progressive Web App`, offering the following features:
  - it is `installable` in user's devices
  - it provides a `service worker` and custom hooks for:
    - generating and display `local (like push) notifications` from the UI
    - accessing information on the `device's hardware`, such as the device's orientation and motion
  - Quick explanation on the developer usage:
    - The service worker code is in the file: `/public/service-worker.js`
    - We register and unregister the service worker in the `RootLayout` component (app/src/app/layout.tsx), using the `useRegisterServiceWorker` custom hook
    - To generate a push notification from the UI:
      - We send a custom message to the service worker, by the `useNotifications` hook:
    ```
      navigator.serviceWorker?.controller?.postMessage({
        type: "custom-push",
        payload: customPushData,
      });
    ```
    - And insige the service-worker.js code:
      - We handle this message:
      ```
        self.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
          console.log("messaeg received in service worker", event);
          if (event.data && event.data.type === "custom-push") {
            ...
          }
        });
      ```
    - And also handle the onClick of a notification:
      ```
      self.addEventListener("notificationclick", function (event) {
        ...
      });
      ```

### Common questions

1. When I start a fresh development server, and I visit a random page, which components (and from which files) are being renderred?

> Based on the way that the NextJS App Router works, the components that are renderred before all the pages are the following:
>
> - `RootLayout` (app/src/app/layout.tsx), which wraps its children with the `ProvidersAndLayout` component, which then wrap its children with the `LargeScreenLayout` (app/src/components/layouts/LargeScreenLayout.tsx) or the `MobileLayout` (app/src/components/layouts/MobileLayout.tsx), depending on the screen width
>
> Afterwards, based on the URL of the current page, we should follow the folder structure of the project.
> If we are visiting for example the `/admin/test` page, then we should initially look into the `/admin` directory, and then in the `/admin/test` directory.
> Each `layout.tsx` file that is located under these directories is rendered, before the final `page.tsx` component.
> The renderred components are the:
>
> - `AdminRootLayout` (app/src/app/admin/layout.tsx)
> - `TestAdminPage` (app/src/app/admin/test/page.tsx)
